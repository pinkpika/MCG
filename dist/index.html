    What is it ?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Originally, a simple css challenge around recursive and semantic rules which became something more complicated than I originally intended. I have a fascination for hermeticism, alchemy and magic, so I thought I might put those in the mix and make a magic circle generator. There is many room for improvements, but I'm quite happy with the results despite some glitches due to the way inner texts are handled.

  <p>
    All the figures are plain css. Javascript is used to generate the markup, which should be self-explanatory. Scroll or refresh the page to generate new circles ad nauseam.
